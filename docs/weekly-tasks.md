# Weekly Tasks
Every Wednesday, PTK tokens will be sent to those providing capital or work into the protocol and will be claimable through the web app or smart contracts directly.

When the first phase is started, 0.1% of PTK (100K PTK) will be issued to those providing work to the protocol each week. Liquidity mining will not be active in the first phase.

Below are the tasks that can earn you PTK, and the full history of distributions is provided below for transparency.
