# Testing Guide

At Protekt we want to invite *every* user, from completely new to DeFi to an experienced developer to test our platform. 

We're building Protekt for you, so today we're inviting you to test it.

We've put together a short guide covering everything needed, if there are any questions feel free to get in touch on our [telegram](https://t.me/protektdefi)

We invite you to read our docs to learn more about how the protocol works.

## Setting up a decentralised wallet
To access decentralised applications, you will need a decentralised wallet. Our favourite is [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

For a quick guide on how to setup a MetaMask wallet take a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWfZnjkhhhg&t=459s)

After setting up a wallet, you will need to change the address to the Kovan test network.

- cDai
- pcdai
- shpcdai
