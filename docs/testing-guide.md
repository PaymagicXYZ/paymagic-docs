# Testing Guide

At Protekt we want to invite *every* user, from completely new to DeFi to an experienced developer to test our platform. 

We're building Protekt for you, so today we're inviting you to test it.

We've put together a short guide covering everything needed, if there are any questions feel free to get in touch on our [telegram](https://t.me/protektdefi)

We invite you to read our docs to learn more about how the protocol works.

## Setting up a decentralised wallet

To access decentralised applications, you will need a decentralised wallet. Our favourite is [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/).

For a quick guide on how to setup a MetaMask wallet take a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWfZnjkhhhg&t=459s)

After setting up a wallet, you will need to change the address to the Kovan test network.

## Adding token addresses to your wallet
T
o add tokens to your address, scroll down to the bottom of your MetaMask wallet and click add Token.

From here, if you are on Kovan, enter the address and the rest of the values will be autofilled.

- weth address: 0xd0A1E359811322d97991E03f863a0C30C2cF029C
- dai address: 0x4F96Fe3b7A6Cf9725f59d353F723c1bDb64CA6Aa
- cDai address: 0xf0d0eb522cfa50b716b3b1604c4f0fa6f04376ad
- pcDai: 0x0584815FA77F397e79E31E7663FE0543d03a5EDD
- shpcDai: 0x7aD9d1Cd1a392f53Bb8F91A085e20A3c37BEc0e7


## Getting the test tokens
First you need to get some kovan ether (ETH). Ether is used for gas for the transactions and we'll use it to get Dai and Weth.

To get Kovan ether use one of the following faucets:
* [faucet](https://faucet.kovan.network/)
* [glitter faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet) *recommended


Next you will need to acquire some kovan Weth (wrapped-ether). To wrap ether, we simply send ether to the weth address.

Ensure you set a non 0 value to transfer, and click confirm.

After the transaction has been confirmed, if you added the weth address to your tokens it should now display a value.
