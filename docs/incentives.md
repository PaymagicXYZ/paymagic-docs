# Protocol Incentives
Every Wednesday, PKT tokens will be claimable by those providing capital or work into the protocol. PKT can't be bought, only earned.

Some examples of tasks that earn weekly PKT include:
**Providing capital**
* Staking in a Protekt Pool (earned by proportional value per block)
* Staking ETH/PKT in the Mothership Vault (earned by proportional value per block)
* Holding pTokens

**Providing work**
* Rewards for fulfilling open weekly grants (found below)
* Rewards for creating audit reports on other DeFi protocols (found below)

## Contributions
### Contributing Work
Once a task is complete, open a PR on this repo for the work that was done. If the PR is merged in, comment with your Ethereum address, and you'll get issued the PKT on the next Wednesday.

### Contributing Capital
Every wednesday, we run a script to get the proportion of capital in each pool and the amount of blocks that it's been present. We will then issue PKT rewards to each depositing address, which will be claimable on our site.
