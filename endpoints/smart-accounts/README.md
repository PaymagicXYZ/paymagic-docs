# üè¶ Smart Accounts

The Automate API is centered around the concept of a **Smart Account,** which is a customized [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io) with a 1 of 2 multi-sig threshold where the customer controls one key and Paymagic controls the other. A Smart Payout Account allows automated transaction execution, batching, fraud prevention, gas management, and cross-chain execution.

Every customer has 1 or more Smart Accounts, which can be on any EVM compatible chain.

* On Avalanche: _/**ava**/account/0xabc...def_
* On Polygon: _/**matic**/account/0xabc...def_
* On Rinkeby: _/**rin**/account/0xabc...def_

In the future, Paymagic will support other Smart Accounts beyond Smart Payout Accounts.
